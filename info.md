## How to use
This section covers the basics on how to use the bot.  
Use command !help for more help.  
Everyone who uses to bot should add their main class and possibly an alt class.  
Example: !addmain mage frost and !addalt rogue combat 
The bot allows users with a role called "autosign" to automatically sign to raids that are marked as "main" raids.  
Example: Get the role with !autosign and add the raid with !addraid MC main  
After the raid is over you can clear the signs manually or use automated feature, which you have to setup.  
More info on this automated feature use !help autoclear.
Some commands have cooldowns. This means if you use the command X amount of times in certain timeframe the cooldown triggers.  
More info on this with !help command.
